How to access a kerberized HDP UI
 
Step 1: Depending on what OS you use, install Kerberos on your local machine. If you are on a Mac, Kerberos would already be there. Google on the installation steps, should be straightforward.
 
Step 2: ssh to .144 or where ever the KDC server is installed. Copy the file /etc/krb5.conf and put it on your local machine at the exact same place => /etc/krb5.conf
=> scp 10.63.150.144:/etc/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf
 
Step 3: Copy an existing keytab from the KDC cluster. In my case, I copied faiz89.keytab
=> scp 10.63.150.144:/etc/security/keytabs/faiz89.keytab .
 
Step 4: Run kint on your local machine. “kinit obtains and caches an initial ticket-granting ticket for principal.”
=> kinit -kt faiz89.keytab faiz89@EXAMPLE.COM  
 
Step 5: Open Firefox (can use Chrome too but steps are a bit different for it. And anyway, Firefox is better than Chrome : )) and type “about:config” in the url. We need to change two parameters.
=> network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris – Change its value to “.netapp.com” because that’s our cluster domain in our setup.
=> network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris - Change its value to “.netapp.com” because that’s our cluster domain in our setup.
 
That’s it. The kerberized UI should work now.
